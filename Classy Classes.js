Classy Classes

This kata is aimed at teaching basics about classes.
Task

Your task is to complete the Person class. It should have a constructor that accepts a person's name as string and a person's age as integer.

It should also have an info / Info (C#) property/getter/accessor/field (depending on your language) which should evaluate to a formatted string like "johns age is 34", using the person's age and name.

  constructor(name, age) {

    this.age = age;
    this.info = `${name}s age is ${age}`;
  }
}
